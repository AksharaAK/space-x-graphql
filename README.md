# GraphQL and Apollo - working with the SpaceX API
---

SpaceX is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company. While its founder has been in the news for very interesting reasons, SpaceX itself provides us with an incredible source of information as a GraphQL API. 

This project is inspired by [The Ultimate API Challenge](https://theultimateapichallenge.com/spacex-api) by [Daniela Fedyakin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-fedyakin/) where she builds a lighter version of the SpaceX website as a React App using the GraphQL API. 

My focus in this project is to learn and explore working with GraphQL APIs while building a multiple page React app with Tailwind for styling.
